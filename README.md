### v0.0.0 CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING. Star this repo for updates! Send issues for feature requests!

**TL;DR** Styleguide template, built with Jekyll. Ready to roll with Github Pages. Push changes in seconds.

whole online brand-styleguides
defined by stringsâ€”

these are a few of my favorite things
```

Moonwings is a simple way to demo and organize your brand assets. It's built in a format that makes sense for designers and developers alike: just add (text) strings! Host instantly on Github Pages. Top secret? Easy, host the generated site on your own server.

The finished styleguide is built on top of (BOOTSTRAP???) (or roll my own???).

## Why

I've worked on many brand styleguides and pattern libraries. I made them at [Nasdaq Product Design](https://twitter.com/NasdaqDesign) as a designer and at [tech@NYU](http://www.techatnyu.org/) and [hackNY](http://hackny.org/a/) as a developer and archivist. It's clear building styleguides is a pain. Out-of-the-box frameworks for styleguides are too simplistic or overwrought.

And yet, documentation, brand styleguides, and pattern libraries are mandatory. They make development faster and easier for everyone. They keep experience and branding consistent. They reduce the incidence of intra-org developer-designer murders. Why should *creating the docs* be difficult and boring? Which leads to the following mindsets:

- **Developers:** "Who gives a $@#$ about weird-@#%&#@$ vector files and colors. #$%& this. I gotta get back to putting the Python on the Angulars." <br>
&rarr; *uses stretched out JPG of last year's logo on public marketing website*
- **Designers:** "#$^#$ PHP @#&!@#$! why do I need to run a build task TWICE I just need to add the SVG!!! and use the right EFFING BLUE!!!!!" <br>
&rarr; *picks whatever font ~*~feels~*~ right, today's menu is 7 different typefaces in every weight*
- **Everyone:** "Styleguide maintenance is for losers. AKA the intern." <br>
&rarr; *intern dies of dysentery*

Well, as the former intern, I can tell you it's real important to do styleguides right. Now I'm making it real easy to do so. As a designer AND developer, I hope Moonwings helps you achieve self-actualization, zen, world peace, etc., etc.
